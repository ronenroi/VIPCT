    Or visually:
    Given the following, for each ray,

    ray         xxxxxxxx
    position    xxxxxxxx

    and
                            yyyyyyyy

    where the y's do not depend on the position
    but only on the ray,
    we want to evaluate a Linear layer on both
    types of data at every position.

    It's as if we constructed

                xxxxxxxxyyyyyyyy

                xxxxxxxxyyyyyyyy
                xxxxxxxxyyyyyyyy

    and sent that through the Linear.
